# dataParsing
This code takes the information that monkeyLogic spits out in a .bhv2 file and outputs all of the information in data structures required to use processing functions written by Rob Gulli (in the Martinez lab) for monkeyLAB output structures. These functions are only for use of bhv2 files that output data from the VR X maze task.
